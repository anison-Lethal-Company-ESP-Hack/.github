## 👁️ What is the ESP Hack?

ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) is a wallhack-style overlay that shows important game elements even when they’re hidden by doors, walls, or darkness. This includes enemy locations, loot items, player positions, and mission-critical objectives.

It doesn’t play the game for you — it just gives you *X-ray level awareness* ⚡.
